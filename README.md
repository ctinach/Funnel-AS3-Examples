Funnel Flash/AS3 Examples
===

A few Flash/AS3 examples using the [funnel.cc](http://funnel.cc/) toolkit. See the Documentation folder for helpful info on getting started with funnel and how to use the Arduino FIO board with funnel. Schematics for the examples are also available in the Documentation folder.

I used these examples for teaching so many of them have the code on frame one of the timeline. A few use document classes. All examples will work with Flash CS5 and higher and there are also many that I saved for versions CS3 and CS4 as well.
